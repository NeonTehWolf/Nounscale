# ![Nounscale â€” What is the best thing?](./public/images/wordmark-tagline.png)  

Nounscale is a simple web service that allows users to choose between two things, ultimately creating a list of the things people chose the most / the least.  
  
## TODO  
  
- Figure out a way to get a list of `n` popular things using a [SPARQL Wikidata query](https://query.wikidata.org/). 
    - Using a dummy dataset in downloadable/word_lists/sample.json at the moment.
